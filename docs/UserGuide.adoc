== Introduction

image:logo.png[ align="center"] +
Carbon Footprint Assessment and Reduction for Resource Efficiency (CAR^2^E) is a multi-platform application that aims to promote Industrial Symbiosis by identifying, prioritising and allocating resources among different companies efficiently and effectively. Companies using CAR^2^E can establish their carbon footprint baseline and strategic sustainability improvement plan, thus increase energy efficiency, reducing material consumption and waste. +

CAR^2^E has a graphical user interface (GUI) which accommodates both mouse and keyboard input. Its main functionality lies in the dragging-and-dropping of life cycle stages and processes of producing an item, which both helps the users visualize the product's life cycle as well as calculate the carbon footprint base line.

This User Guide is meant to provide the necessary information for users, whether new or experienced, who would like to gain more insights about how to use CAR^2^E effectively. The guide consists of the overview of the application and descriptions of its current features.
