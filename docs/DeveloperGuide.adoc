== Introduction

image:logo.png[ align="center"] +
Carbon Footprint Assessment and Reduction for Resource Efficiency (CAR^2^E) is a multi-platform application that aims to promote Industrial Symbiosis by identifying, prioritising and allocating resources among different companies efficiently and effectively. Companies using CAR^2^E can establish their carbon footprint baseline and strategic sustainability improvement plan, thus increase energy efficiency, reducing material consumption and waste. +

CAR^2^E has a graphical user interface (GUI) which accommodates both mouse and keyboard input. Its main functionality lies in the dragging-and-dropping of life cycle stages and processes of producing an item, which both helps the users visualize the product's life cycle as well as calculate the carbon footprint base line.

This Developer Guide is meant to provides the necessary information for developers who are interested in contributing to this application. New developers should begin with <<SettingUp>>. Experienced developers might want begin instead with the <<Design>> section to learn more about how CAR^2^E is structured.


Understanding the implementation of the features in Fastis will be crucial to be able to modify any feature for further improvements.

[[SettingUp]]
== Setting up
This section provides information on setting up the project in order to work on CAR^2^E.

=== Prerequisites

The following programs have to be installed on the computer system before setting up:

. *NodeJS* and *npm*: latest versions
+
[NOTE]
Link to install: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ +
npm is included in the NodeJS installation package
+

. Any *Version Control*
+
[NOTE]
Git is recommended


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open a command prompt (Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, Cygwin, or the Git shell) at the download folder
. Type `npm run init` and press `Enter`
.. Wait for npm to download the necessary modules

=== Verifying the setup

The following steps should be done to verify that the setup of CAR^2^E is correct:

. Verify that there is a `node_modules` folder in the root folder
. Open a command prompt at ths folder
. Type `npm start` and press `Enter`
+
[NOTE]
Only one prompt can be running `npm start` at any one time, +
because Angular is using port 4200 and blocks it.

[[Design]]
== Design

This section describes how CAR^2^E is built and how its different components interact and work with each other.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture_* Diagram given below (<<Figure1>>) explains the high-level design of CAR^2^E. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

=== Components

<TBC>

=== Data Service

<TBC>

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

== Dev Ops

=== Build

We build the app with basic `ng build` function from `npm`.

=== Continuous integration

As of now, there is no continuous integration implemetation. In the future, we plan to use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our project.

=== Coverage reporting

As of now, there is no coverage report implemetation. In the future, we plan to `@angular/cli` built-in code-coverage on our project.

=== Managing dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `root/package.json` (for modules) and `root/angular.json` (for scripts). Add any other dependencies as necessary, and don't forget to include them in the respective file.
